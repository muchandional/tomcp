# toMCP

**Turn any website into an MCP server + Chat with any website.**

Simply add `tomcp.org/` before any URL:

```
tomcp.org/docs.stripe.com
tomcp.org/react.dev
tomcp.org/your-docs.com/api
```
Or go to https://tomcp.org and paste the URL there.

## Why toMCP?

### Clean Data, Fewer Tokens

Standard `web_fetch` tools dump raw HTML into your AI's context—navbars, scripts, footers, and noise. toMCP runs pages through a **readability parser** and converts to **clean markdown**, using a fraction of the tokens.

### Persistent Documentation Context

AI assistants hallucinate API details when they lack documentation. MCP Resources are **pinned as permanent, read-only context**—the model won't skip or forget them. Ideal for framework docs, API references, and internal team docs.

### web_fetch vs MCP Resources

| | web_fetch | MCP Resource |
|--|-----------|--------------|
| Data | Raw HTML with noise | Clean markdown |
| Tokens | High | Low |
| Persistence | Per-request | Always available |
| Hallucination | Higher | Lower |
| JS Support | Full (SPAs / Dynamic) | Static Only (SSG) |

## Supported AI Tools

- **Cursor** - `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Claude Desktop** - `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windsurf** - `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
- **VS Code** - `.vscode/mcp.json`

## How It Works

### MCP Config
1. Visit [tomcp.org](https://tomcp.org)
2. Enter any website URL
3. Select your AI tool
4. Copy the generated MCP config
5. Add it to your tool's config file
6. Restart your AI tool

### Chat
1. Visit [tomcp.org](https://tomcp.org)
2. Paste any website URL
3. Click "Start Chat"
4. Ask questions about the website's content

## Example Config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docs-stripe-com": {
      "url": "https://tomcp.org/docs.stripe.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Chat API

```bash
curl -X POST https://tomcp.org/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "docs.stripe.com", "message": "How do I create a payment intent?"}'
```

## AI Models

### Free Models (No API Key Required)
These models are available for everyone with no setup:
- **Llama 3.1 8B** (Meta) - Default model, fast and capable
- **Hermes 2 Pro** (NousResearch) - Great for reasoning
- **Mistral 7B** (Mistral) - Efficient instruction-following
- **Gemma 7B LoRA** (Google) - Lightweight and fast

### paid Models (API Key Required)
Add your Cloudflare Workers AI API key to unlock these models:
- **Llama 3.3 70B** (Meta) - Most powerful Llama model
- **DeepSeek R1 32B** (DeepSeek) - Advanced reasoning
- **Mistral Large** (Mistral) - Enterprise-grade
- **Gemma 3 12B** (Google) - Latest Gemma
- **GPT OSS 120B/20B** (OpenAI) - Open-source GPT variants

## Adding Your API Key

You can add your own Cloudflare Workers AI API key to:
1. **Unlock all paid models** - Access larger, more capable models
2. **Bypass rate limits** - No daily request limits
3. **Use your own quota** - Charges go to your Cloudflare account

### How to Get an API Key
1. Go to [Cloudflare Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/rest-api/#1-get-api-token-and-account-id)
2. Create an API token with Workers AI permissions
3. Copy the token

### How to Add Your Key
1. Start a chat session on [tomcp.org](https://tomcp.org)
2. Below the chat input, you'll see "Add API key from Cloudflare Workers AI"
3. Paste your API key and click "Save"
4. paid models will now be unlocked in the dropdown

### Where Is the API Key Stored?
- Your API key is stored **locally in your browser** using `localStorage`
- Key name: `tomcp_api_key`
- The key is sent with each chat request but **never stored on our servers**
- You can remove it anytime by clicking "Remove" in the API key section

## How It Works (Technical)

### Model Fetching
The available models are fetched dynamically from the Cloudflare Workers AI API:
1. Frontend calls `GET /models` endpoint on page load
2. Worker fetches models from `api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{id}/ai/models/search`
3. Models are filtered to "Text Generation" tasks and cached for 5 minutes
4. Frontend displays free models as enabled, paid models as disabled (until API key is added)

### Chat Flow
1. User enters a URL and starts chatting
2. Worker fetches the static HTML and converts it to clean Markdown (JavaScript is not executed, so SPAs or dynamically-loaded content won't be captured)
3. Content is sent to the selected AI model with the user's message
4. Response is returned to the user

### Rate Limiting
Without an API key:
- 5 requests per IP per day

With your API key:
- No rate limits (uses your Cloudflare account quota)
